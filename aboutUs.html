				<h2> MAKING HISTORY </h2>
				<p> SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only 
				private company capable of returning a spacecraft from low Earth orbit, which it first 
				accomplished in 2010. The company made history again in 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft 
				became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to and from the International Space Station.

				SpaceX successfully achieved the historic first reflight of an orbital class rocket in 2017, 
				and the company now regularly launches flight-proven rockets. In 2018, SpaceX began 
				launching Falcon Heavy, the world’s most powerful operational rocket by a factor of two.

				<h2> ADVANCING THE FUTURE </h2>
				<p>
					As one of the world’s fastest growing providers of launch services, SpaceX has secured over 
					100 missions to its manifest, representing over $12 billion on contract. These include 
					commercial satellite launches as well as US government missions. SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft 
					is flying numerous cargo resupply missions to the space station under a series of Commercial 
					Resupply Services contracts. Dragon was designed from the outset to carry humans to space 
					and will soon fly astronauts under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program.

					Building on the achievements of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, SpaceX is working on a next generation 
					of fully reusable launch vehicles that will be the most powerful ever built, capable of carrying humans 
					to Mars and other destinations in the solar system.

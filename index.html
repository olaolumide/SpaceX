					SpaceX tests its engines, vehicle structures, and systems at a 4,000-acre state-of-the-art rocket development facility in McGregor, Texas. Outfitted with 
					16 specialized test stands, the facility validates for flight every Merlin engine that powers the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, and every Draco thruster 
					that controls the Dragon spacecraft. Before shipping to the launch site, each rocket booster is tested with all nine Merlin engines firing at 1.71 million 
					pounds of thrust for up to three minutes—the same as actual flight duration. Established in 2003, the site is also equipped to handle post-flight inspections and 
					testing for flight-proven hardware. In addition to qualification testing for flight, the facility oversees development testing, including engines and components 
					for SpaceX’s next generation launch vehicle, which will transport humans to Mars and other destinations.
